# Create and deploy a scoring model to predict heart failure on IBM Cloud with the Watson Data Platform

In this Code Pattern, we will use a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio to build a predictive model that demonstrates a potential health care use case.
This a customized version of the Node.js sample app that is available with the [Watson Machine Learning Service on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/PredictiveModeling/index.html#WMLgettingstarted)
See the [original app](https://github.com/pmservice/predictive-modeling-samples) for a walkthrough of the source code.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Build a predictive model within a Jupyter Notebook
* Deploy the model to IBM Watson Machine Learning service
* Access the Machine Learning model via either APIs or a Nodejs app
